Hello World!
In the programming world, "Hello world" program is the de facto standard to start coding in any programming language. Similarly I'm starting my blogging journey through this blog, and hence this is my first post "Hello World!".

I'm an engineer by training hence I always try to see logics behind happenings, I search for solutions for the problems around me. My goal on this blog is to divide problems/concepts and solve them in such a way which is easier to undersand and grasp. I'll post technology related content in this blog. 

A lot more to come in coming few weeks.

Jai Hind!
